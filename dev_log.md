## [2026-10-10] P003 — Initialize the Real Expo Android App and Verify GitHub Workflow

### Scope
- Scaffold the actual React Native / Expo application around the P001/P002 architecture documentation.
- Establish the minimal routing shell (app/index.tsx, app/_layout.tsx) without placeholder screens.
- Configure strict TypeScript, ESLint, and ensure basic CI verification tools execute.
- Preserve Git history and securely synchronize with `https://github.com/shojibahmed24/polytalk.git`.

### Actions Taken
- Verified remote Git state. Target remote is entirely empty, enabling safe push.
- Scaffolded Expo app using `create-expo-app` (SDK 57) in a temporary directory and carefully merged files into the `PolyTalk` workspace, avoiding documentation overwrites.
- Downgraded `eslint` to `^8.57.0` to ensure `eslint-config-expo` compatibility. 
- Designed a scalable root layout and initial screen showcasing the "App Foundation Status" reflecting the design system tokens.
- Updated `README.md` with explicit Android/Windows development instructions.
- Modified `.gitignore` securely.

### Commands Executed
- `git remote add origin https://github.com/shojibahmed24/polytalk.git`
- `npx create-expo-app@latest PolyTalkTemp`
- Merged temporary template assets to main directory.
- `npm install --ignore-scripts`
- `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck`

### Verification Results
- **TypeScript**: Passed (`tsc --noEmit`).
- **Lint**: Passed (`eslint .`).
- **Android Test**: We verified the basic Expo configuration works. (Note: physical Android device APK build was *not* performed because this task focuses on initializing the source shell, not triggering cloud/native builds).

### Remaining Blockers
- None for the basic shell. Future steps require testing the real Puter.js SDK compatibility in Hermes/React Native.

### Next Step
**P004 — ...**
